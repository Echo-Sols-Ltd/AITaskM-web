## **Dashboard Overview (1:00 - 1:45)**

Welcome to your command center! This dashboard is where the magic happens. See these cards up here? They're showing you real-time insights into your productivity. We've got your total tasks, completion rates, productivity scores, and even your streak - because who doesn't love a good streak, right?

Now watch this - our AI is actually generating task recommendations based on your work patterns. And if you want to find something specific, just type in this search box. Everything updates in real-time.

Look at these beautiful progress bars and the way everything animates smoothly. We spent a lot of time making sure this feels good to use, not just functional.

## **Task Management System (1:45 - 2:30)**
*[Scene: Task Creation and Task Completion pages]*

Let's talk about actually getting work done. Creating tasks is effortless - our AI assistant can help generate relevant tasks for you. But here's where it gets really powerful.

See how we can set priority levels? High priority tasks get this red indicator, medium gets yellow, and low priority gets green. Everything is color-coded so you know what needs attention.

When you're working on a task, you can track your progress with this slider, upload files by just dragging and dropping them, add detailed notes about what you've accomplished, and even track blockers that are getting in your way.

## **Pomodoro Timer & Focus Tools (2:30 - 3:15)**
*[Scene: Pomodoro Timer page]*

Now, let's talk about staying focused. We've built in a beautiful Pomodoro timer that helps you work in focused bursts. Look at this circular progress indicator - it's not just pretty, it actually helps you visualize your time.

You can customize everything - work intervals, break times, even turn on focus mode to minimize distractions. And see this task list on the side? You can manage what you're working on right from the timer page.

The best part? It tracks your sessions automatically, so you can see exactly how many hours you've spent in deep focus work.

These badges have different rarity levels too - common, rare, epic, and legendary. And check out this leaderboard - you can see how you stack up against your teammates. A little friendly competition never hurt anyone, right?

Your level, points, and streaks are all tracked here. It's like leveling up in a game, except you're leveling up your actual productivity.
